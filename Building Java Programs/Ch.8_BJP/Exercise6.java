// The following exercise is implemented and tested in PointExample folder
// Add the following accessor method to the Point class:

// public boolean isCollinear(Point p1, Point p2)

// Returns whether this Point is collinear with the given two other Points. Points
// are collinear if a straight line can be drawn that connects them. Two basic examples
// are three points that have the same x- or y-coordinate. The more general case can be
// determined by calculating the slope of the line between each pair of points and checking
// whether this slope is the same for all pairs of points. Use the formula (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
// to determine the slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
