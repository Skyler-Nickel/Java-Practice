# Practice
The following code implements solutions from the textbook Building Java Programs by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp.

## Chapter 1
Chapter 1 covers introductory topics such as: 
- Program errors 
- Procedural decomposition 
- String literals 
- Escape sequences
- Println/print statements
- Identifiers and keywords

Program exercises cover basic static methods and printing to the console.

## Chapter 2
Chapter 2 covers topics such as:
- Primitive types
- Expressions
- Literals
- Precedence
- Mixing and type casting
- For Loops
- Scope

Program exercises cover for loops to print to console.

## Chapter 3
Chapter 3 covers topics such as:
- Parameters
- Methods that return values
- Using object (String/Scanner)

Program exercises cover writing methods that accept arguments/parameters and Strings.

## Chapter 4
Chapter 4 covers topics such as:
- If/else Statements
- Cumulative Algorithms (Sums, Min/Max loops, Roundoff Errors)
- Text Processing (Char, Text algorithms, Printf)
- Methods with conditional execution (Pre/Post conditions, Throwing Exceptions, Return values)

Programs exercises cover writing methods accepting parameters and returning values. Also using Scanner to read input from console.

## Chapter 5
Chapter 5 covers topics such as:
- While loops
- Fencepost Algorithms (using if statements and Sentinel Loops)
- Boolean type (Logical operators, Short-Circuited Evaluation, Boolean Zen)
- User Errors (Scanner Lookahead, Handling user errors)
- Assertions and program logic

Program exercises cover writing methods accepting parameters and using while loops/fenceposts.

## Chapter 6
Chapter 6 covers topics such as:
- File-Reading Basics (Files and File objects)
- Line-Based Processing (String Scanners and Lines/Token combos)
- Advanced File Processing (PrintStream and Guaranteering that files can be read)

Program exercises cover using a scanner to read in txt files and writing to files.

## Chapter 7
Chapter 7 covers topics such as:
- Array Basics (Constructing/Traversing, Accessing, Initializing, Arrays class)
- Array-Traversal algorithms (Printing, Searching and Replacing, Equality, Reversing)
- Reference Semantics
- Advanced Array Techniques (Shifting values, Arrays of Objects, Command-Line Arguements)
- Multidimensional Arrays (Rectangular and Jagged)

Program exercises cover using arrays for problem solving.

## Chapter 8
Chapter 8 covers topics such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects)
- Object State and Behavior (Fields, Methods, Implicit Parameters, Mutators and Accessors)
- Object Initialization (Keyword this and Multiple Constructors)
- Encapsulation (Private fields, Class invariants, Internal Implementations)

Program exercises cover the above descriptions, such as creating classes and objects, and writing mutators and accessors.

## Chapter 9
Chapter 9 covers topics such as:
- Inheritance Basics (Nonprogramming Hierarchies, Extending a class, Overriding Methods)
- Interacting with the Superclass (Calling Overridden Methods, Accessing Inherited Fields, Calling a Superclass's Constructor)
- Polymorphism (Polymorphism mechanics, Interpreting Inheritance Code, Interpreting Complex Calls)
- Inheritance and Design (Is-a versus Has-a relationship)
- Interfaces (Implementing and benefits of Interfaces)

Program exercises cover the above descriptions, such as using inheritance and implementing interfaces.

## Chapter 10
Chapter 10 covers topics such as:
- ArrayList (Basic operations, Searching methods, Adding/Removing, Initializing, Wrapper Classes)
- Comparable Interface (Natural ordering, compareTo, Implementing Comparable)

Program exercises cover the above descriptions, mainly using ArrayList operations to solve problems.

## Chapter 11
Chapter 11 covers topics such as:
- Lists (Collections, LinkedList vs. ArrayList, Iterators, ADTS (Abstract Data Types)
- Sets (Set concepts, TreeSet vs. HashSet, Set operations)
- Maps (Basic map operations, Viewing maps (keySet and values), TreeMap vs. HashMap)

Program exercises cover the above topics, mainly using collections.

## Chapter 12
Chapter 12 covers topics such as:
- This description will be added later...
