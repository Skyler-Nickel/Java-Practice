// Exercise 1:
// Modify the Sieve program developed in section 11.1 to make two optimizations. First, instead of storing
// all integers up to the maximum in the numbers list, store only 2 and all odd numbers from 3 upward. Second,
// write code to ensure that if the first number in the numbers list ever reaches the square root of the
// maximum, all remaining values from the numbers list are moved into the primes list.
